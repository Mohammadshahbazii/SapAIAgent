# Building a Prompt-Driven Task Automation App

This guide outlines a practical approach to build an application that can interpret
user prompts and orchestrate the right capabilities to complete the requested tasks.
It combines natural language understanding, a catalog of actionable skills, and a
planning/orchestration layer to deliver reliable results.

## 1. Clarify Product Goals
1. **Supported task categories** – Identify the domains you want the agent to handle
   (e.g., data analysis, document drafting, design assistance, engineering
   calculations). Start narrow so that you can curate reliable skills and extend over
   time.
2. **User interfaces** – Decide where users will interact with the agent (desktop,
   web, chat widget, API) and whether synchronous or asynchronous execution is
   required.
3. **Success criteria** – Define measurable success signals (task completion rate,
   user satisfaction, time saved) to guide iterative improvements.

## 2. Gather Capabilities as "Skills"
1. **Inventory existing automations** – Scriptable APIs, microservices, RPA bots,
   and templates become the building blocks for the agent.
2. **Wrap each capability** in a thin adapter that:
   - Describes the skill in natural language (purpose, inputs, outputs).
   - Validates incoming parameters.
   - Handles execution and error normalization.
3. **Version and test skills** so that orchestration can rely on their contracts.

## 3. Choose an LLM & Prompting Strategy
1. **Model selection** – Pick a language model that fits your latency, cost, and data
   privacy requirements. Consider hybrid setups (local model for classification,
   hosted model for reasoning) when necessary.
2. **System prompts** – Craft role and safety instructions that keep the agent on
   scope.
3. **Few-shot exemplars** – Provide sample prompt-to-plan demonstrations to improve
   reliability.
4. **Memory strategy** – Combine short-term conversation state with long-term
   knowledge bases (vector stores, SQL, CRM) if tasks depend on user context.

## 4. Implement a Planner-Orchestrator
1. **Parsing & classification** – Use the LLM (or fine-tuned classifiers) to map a
   free-form prompt to candidate intents or skill sequences.
2. **Planning loop** – Allow the agent to break multi-step tasks into an ordered
   plan. Impose guardrails (max steps, allowed skills, confirmation prompts) to avoid
   loops.
3. **Execution management** – Sequentially call skills, track intermediate results,
   and recover from failures with retries or fallbacks.
4. **Human-in-the-loop controls** – Ask for confirmation when cost, safety, or
   ambiguity thresholds are exceeded.

## 5. Data Flow & Storage
1. **State tracking** – Log every prompt, plan, action, and outcome for analytics.
2. **Secure secret management** – Store API keys and credentials via a secrets vault.
3. **Auditability** – Maintain structured records for compliance and debugging.

## 6. UX Considerations
1. **Transparent feedback** – Show users the plan, current step, and final summary to
   build trust.
2. **Intervention points** – Allow users to edit inputs, approve actions, or cancel
   long-running steps.
3. **Result packaging** – Provide downloadable artifacts (reports, code snippets)
   formatted for the user’s workflow.

## 7. Testing & Evaluation
1. **Unit tests** – Cover individual skills and the planner’s decision logic with
   deterministic test data.
2. **Simulation harness** – Replay real prompts against mocked services to measure
   success rates and safety incidents.
3. **Canary rollouts** – Release updates to a small user cohort before global
   deployment.

## 8. Operations & Continuous Improvement
1. **Telemetry dashboards** – Monitor latency, cost, and error trends.
2. **Feedback loops** – Capture user ratings and incorporate supervised fine-tuning
   or retrieval updates.
3. **Skill lifecycle** – Add, deprecate, and improve skills based on observed demand
   and performance.

## 9. Security, Privacy, and Governance
1. **Access control** – Ensure the agent only invokes skills the user is authorized
   to use.
2. **Data minimization** – Filter sensitive data before sending it to external LLMs
   and redact logs.
3. **Policy compliance** – Encode business rules and regulatory constraints inside
   the planner or as validation layers.

## 10. Roadmap for Incremental Delivery
1. Ship a **minimum viable agent** with a handful of curated skills and tight
   guardrails.
2. Collect feedback, expand the skill catalog, and refine prompts based on observed
   failures.
3. Introduce autonomous planning for multi-step tasks once single-step reliability
   is proven.

By combining a structured skill library with a planning orchestrator and robust
operational practices, you can deliver an app that accepts natural language prompts
and consistently executes the underlying tasks.
